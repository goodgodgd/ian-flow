Welcome to Ian's Blog!  

Ian is me, an assistant professor in a university.  

This blog deals with anything that flows in my mind, mainly technical issues, and is written mainly in Korean.

My interests include robotics, SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping), VO (visual odometry),  Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
